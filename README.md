This is my project so far for my text based game. Right now I have the storyline finished and I let the player insert their username then their health shows up. I also added a way to get rid of health when your character takes damage. I've made 9 rooms for the game map and im currently on the part where i add things to fight and pick up in each of the rooms until the boss fight in rooom 9. Right now I added 1 monster with 50 health and 20 damage for rooom 2 but im just trying to find out how to make it show up when the player is in the 2nd room.
